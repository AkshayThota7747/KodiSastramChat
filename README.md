# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Requirements

## Facebook Auth

To enable Facebook authentication in your application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Facebook Developers Account**

   - If you don't have a Facebook Developers account, go to the [Facebook for Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/) and sign up.

2. **Create a New App**

   - Once you have logged in to your Facebook Developers account, click on the "Create App" button and select "For Everything Else" to create a new app.

3. **Get App ID and Secret Key**

   - After creating the new app, you will be provided with an App ID and a Secret Key. Copy these credentials as you will need to use them later.

4. **Configure Authentication Methods**

   - In your application's code or settings, find the section for authentication methods or social logins.
   - Add the App ID and Secret Key obtained from the Facebook Developer dashboard to the appropriate fields for the Facebook authentication method.

5. **OAuth Redirect URI**
   - While configuring the Facebook app, you will also need to set up the OAuth redirect URI. This is the URL to which Facebook will redirect users after they have authenticated your app.
   - Copy the OAuth redirect URI from your application's authentication settings and add it to your Facebook app configuration.

Once you've completed these steps, your application should be set up to use Facebook authentication, allowing users to log in using their Facebook accounts. Make sure to test the authentication flow thoroughly to ensure everything is working as expected.
